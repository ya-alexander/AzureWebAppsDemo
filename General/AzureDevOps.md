# Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps Services is a **cloud service for collaborating on code development**. It provides an integrated set of features that you access through your web browser or IDE client, including the following:

* Git repositories for source control of your code
* Build and release management to support continuous integration and delivery of your apps
* Agile tools to support planning and tracking your work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods
* [A variety of tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing, load testing, and continuous testing]
* [Highly customizable dashboards for sharing progress and trends]
* [Built-in wiki for sharing information with your team]

## Azure Pipelines
* Build pipelines vs. release pipelines
* Either use YAML or visual designer to define pipelines
* If YAML, then the build is code (version controlled etc.)
